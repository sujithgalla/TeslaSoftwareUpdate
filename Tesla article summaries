The Convention on Road Traffic was signed 1968 in Vienna, commonly called “Vienna Convention” (VC), under control of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). It 
has been ratified by 74 countries.32 The UNECE Global Forum for Road Traffic Safety (WP.1)is responsible for amendments to the VC.33
 The VC is designed to harmonize international traffic rules and to increase road safety. On 23 March 2016, following amendment to the VC 
was enacted,  enabling automated driving.34Article 8, paragraph 5bis:“Vehicle systems which influence the way vehicles are driven and are not in conformity ... shall 
be deemed to be in conformity ... when such systems can be overridden or switched off by the driver.”
In other words: “Automated driving technologies transferring driving tasks to the vehicle will be explicitly allowed in traffic, provided that these technologies are in conformity with the United 
Nations vehicle regulations or can be overridden or switched off by the driver.”35
In Germany the Lower House of Parliament (Bundestag) applied the amendment Article 8, paragraph 5bis VC on 29 September 2016.
36This adoption gave legal certainty for new automated driving functionalities and even existing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) like autonomous cruise control (ACC)
